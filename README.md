# üê∞ Bencher

[Bencher](https://bencher.dev) is a suite of continuous benchmarking tools designed to help catch performance regressions in CI.

It consists of:

- `bencher` CLI
- Bencher API Server
- Bencher Web UI

The best place to start is the [Bencher Quick Start](https://bencher.dev/docs/how-to/quick-start) tutorial.

## Run Bencher Locally

Pull and run Docker images:

```
docker compose up -d
```

OR

Build and run Docker images:

```
./scripts/docker_run.sh
```

Then open your browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Contributing

The easiest way to contribute is to open the repo in GitPod.
Everything you need will already be there!
It is best to connect to the GitPod instance with VS Code Desktop via SSH.
There is a hotkey set to tapping caps lock twice to prompt the web VS Code to create a VS Code Desktop SSH session.
For more details see the [GitPod docs here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode).
Once set up, both the UI and API should be built, running, and seeded at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and [localhost:61016](http://localhost:61016) respectively.

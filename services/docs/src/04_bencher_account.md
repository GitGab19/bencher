# Create a Bencher Account

You need a Bencher account in order to store, view, and compare your historical benchmarks.
It's easy to create an account using the Bencher Web GUI. Navigate to [https://bencher.dev/signup](https://bencher.dev/signup), and follow the steps to create an account and login.

Once logged in, there should be a banner that displays your API token. If not, navigate to [https://bencher.dev/account/token](https://bencher.dev/account/token). In either case, copy your API token. You will need it for the next step, [saving your benchmark results with Bencher](./05_save_your_results.md).

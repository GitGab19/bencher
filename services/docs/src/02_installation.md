# Installation

The first step is to install the `bencher` CLI. You can do so a few different ways:

- Using the convience script
- Via brew, Chocolatey, or scoop
- Building from source

**TODO**

## Verify Installation

Finally, verify that the install worked correctly by running `bencher --version`. You should see something like `bencher-cli 0.1.0` output to the console. You are now ready to [run your first benchmark](./03_first_benchmark).

      <h3>Indemnification</h3>
      <p>
        You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Bencher, its corporate
        affiliates, independent contractors, service providers, and consultants,
        and each of their respective directors, employees, and agents, from and
        against any claims, damages, costs, liabilities, and expenses
        (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out
        of or related to any Communication you post, store, or otherwise

        the Services, including without limitation any actual or threatened
        suit, demand, or claim arising out of or relating to the Communication,
        your conduct, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of the
        rights of any third party.
      </p>
      <h3>Modifications</h3>
      <p>
        We may revise these Terms from time to time, on a prospective basis, and
        we will always post the most up-to-date version on our website. If we
        determine, in our sole discretion, that a modification to these Terms
        materially affects your rights, we will notify you (by, for example,
        sending a message to your account email). By using or continuing to use
        or access the Services after any revisions have come into effect, you
        agree to be bound by the revised Terms. Unless we provide you with
        specific notice, no changes to the Terms will apply retroactively. You
        are responsible for regularly reviewing these Terms.
      </p>
      <h3>Mandatory Arbitration and Dispute Resolution</h3>
      <p>
        <b>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try
        for 60 days to resolve it informally. You may send us the details of
        your concern by <a href="mailto:info@bencher.dev">contacting us</a>.
        However, if Bencher is not able to informally resolve your complaint,
        you and Bencher agree to individual binding arbitration under JAMS
        Alternative Dispute resolution (“JAMS”) and the Federal Arbitration Act
        (“FAA”), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. The
        arbitration will be conducted under the JAMS Commercial Arbitration
        Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes and
        the arbitrator’s decision will be final except for a limited right of
        review under the FAA. The following applies to any arbitration
        proceedings between you and Bencher:
      </p>
      <p>
        Before moving an unresolved informal dispute into arbitration, you must
        first send us a Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the
        claim or dispute and the specific relief sought. This notice may be sent
        via email or U.S. mail to:{" "}
        <a href="mailto:info@bencher.dev">our email</a> or Pompeii LLC, 15114
        Kamputa Drive, Centreville, VA, 20120.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration
        with JAMS within ONE (1) YEAR from when it first could be filed.
        Otherwise, it is permanently barred. If applicable law prohibits a
        one-year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be
        asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever feasible, the arbitration will be held telephonically unless
        the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead.
        You may choose the location of any in-person hearing from either your
        county of residence; or, if you are a business, the county of your
        principal place of business; or, Pompeii LLC's principal place of
        business in Centreville, VA.
      </p>
      <p>
        The enforcement of the arbitrator’s award will be controlled by and
        conducted in conformity with the FAA. Judgment upon any award may be
        entered in any court holding jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding our agreement to arbitrate disputes as provided above,
        the following EXCEPTIONS will apply to the resolution of disputes
        between us:
      </p>
      <h5>Small Claims Court</h5>
      <p>
        If the claim qualifies, either you or Bencher may bring an action in
        small claims court in Fairfax County, VA. Any small claims court action
        must be filed within one year from when it first could be filed.
        Otherwise, the claim is permanently barred.
      </p>
      <h5>Injunctive Relief</h5>
      <p>
        Bencher may bring a lawsuit against you in any court of competent
        jurisdiction solely for injunctive relief to stop any unauthorized use
        or abuse of the Services, or any intellectual property infringement. In
        these instances, Bencher may seek injunctive relief without first
        engaging in the informal dispute resolution or arbitration process, as
        described above in these Terms of Use.
      </p>
      <h5>Disputes not Covered by Arbitration</h5>
      <p>
        In the event that arbitration is found to be inapplicable or
        unenforceable for any reason, or if you exercise the option to opt-out
        of arbitration as provided below, the claim at issue will be brought
        under judicial proceedings in federal or state courts in Fairfax County,
        VA, and you and Pompeii LLC consent to personal jurisdiction and
        exclusive venue in such courts.
      </p>
      <h5>Option to Opt Out of Arbitration</h5>
      <p>
        You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither
        you nor Bencher can require the other to participate in an arbitration
        proceeding. To opt out, you must notify us in writing within 30 days of
        the date that you first became subject to the arbitration provision in
        these Terms. To opt out you must send us a clear statement that you want
        to opt out of arbitration, along with your name, residence or business
        address, and the email address associated with your account by{" "}
        <a href="mailto:info@bencher.dev">contacting us</a>.
      </p>
      <h5>No Class Actions</h5>
      <p>
        You may only bring individual claims. Under no circumstances are you
        allowed to bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class.
        Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general
        actions, and any other proceedings where someone acts in a
        representative capacity are not allowed. Any combining of individual
        proceedings must have the consent of all parties.
      </p>
      <h3>Applicable law</h3>
      <p>
        The laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, excluding its conflict of law
        provisions, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to
        these Terms or the Services.
      </p>
      <h3>Termination</h3>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding any of these Terms, Bencher reserves the right, without
        notice and in its sole discretion, to terminate your license to use the
        Services, and to block or prevent your access to and use of the
        Services. Bencher reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any
        reason at any time. In the event of termination of access to the
        Services for any reason, you have no right to obtain a copy of any data
        or communications you stored or effected via the Services, or any other
        data.
      </p>
      <h3>Entire agreement</h3>
      <p>
        These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Instant
        Attorney with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and
        supersede and replace any prior version of the Terms. These Terms create
        no third party beneficiary rights.
      </p>
      <h3>Waiver, Severability, and Assignment</h3>
      <p>
        Bencher's failure to enforce a provision of these Terms is not a waiver
        of its right to do so later. If any provision of these Terms is found
        unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full
        effect and an enforceable Term or Terms will be substituted reflecting
        our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights
        under these Terms, and any attempt to do so will be void. Bencher may
        assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any
        successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.

- Moved Docker UI build stage into its own `builder.Dockerfile`, mirroring the API setup
- Created a better default for the UI's backend API URL, basically `this-host:61016`
- Created a [walking skeleton](https://wiki.c2.com/?WalkingSkeleton) of adding Rust + WASM modules to the UI in both dev and CI/CD

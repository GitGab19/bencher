Adapters convert benchmark harness output into standardized JSON, Bencher Metric Format (BMF).
They are provided to the `bencher run` CLI command with the `--adapter` flag.
In gerenal, it is best to use the most specific adapter for your use case.

Example of BMF:

```
{
    "benchmark_name": {
        "latency": {
            value: 88.0,
            lower_bound: 87.42,
            upper_bound: 88.88
        }
    }
}
```

## 🪄 Magic

The Magic Adapter (`magic`) is just that magic!
It can automagically convert from any supported benchmark harness output into BMF.
Or at least that is the goal.
It is therefore the default adapter for `bencher run`,
but it is best used for exploration.
In CI, you should use the most specific adapter for your use case.

## \{...\} JSON

The JSON Adapter (`json`) expects BMF JSON.
It is perfect for integrating a custom benchmark harnesses with Bencher.

> 🐰 Note: The `bencher mock` command generates mock BMF metrics.

## 🦀 Rust

The Rust Adapter (`rust`) is a superset of `rust_bench` and `rust_criterion`.

## 🦀 Rust Bench

The Rust Bench Adapter (`rust_bench`) expects [libtest bench](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/tests/index.html#benchmarks) output.

## 🦀 Rust Criterion

The Rust Criterion Adapter (`rust_criterion`) expects [Criterion](https://docs.rs/criterion/latest/criterion/) output.

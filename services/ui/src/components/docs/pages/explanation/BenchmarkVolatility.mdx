Most benchmarking harnesses use the [system wall clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elapsed_real_time) to measure latency and throughput.
There is very helpful, as these are the exact metrics that we as developers care the most about.
However, general purpose CI environments are often noisy and inconsistent when measuring wall clock time.
When performing [continuous benchmarking](/docs/explanation/continuous-benchmarking), this volatility adds unwanted noise into the results.

There are a few options for handling this:
- [Relative benchmarking](http://localhost:3000/docs/how-to/track-benchmarks)
- Dedicated CI runners, like [BuildJet](https://buildjet.com)
- Switching benchmark harnesses to one that counts instructions as opposed to wall time

Or embrace the chaos! Continuous benchmarking doesn't have to be perfect.
Yes, reducing the volatility and thus the noise in your continuous benchmarking environment will allow you to detect ever finer performance regressions.
However, don't let perfect be the enemy of good here!

You might look at this graph and think, "Wow, that's crazy!" But ask yourself, can your current CI setup detect a factor of two or even a factor of ten performance regression in your most important code? Probably not!

Even with all of the noise from a CI environment, tracking wall clock benchmarks can still pay great dividends in catching performance regressions before they reach your customers in production.
Over time, as your software performance management matures you can build from there.
In the mean time, just use your regular CI.

Bencher is also great for tracking benchmarks run locally.
So you can finally stop copypastaing the results from that gold standard, bare metal, quiet as field mouse benchmark run that you manually fire up once every release.

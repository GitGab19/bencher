Thresholds can be created for the unique combination of a Metric Kind, Branch, and Testbed.
These are statistical thresholds that use either the
[Z-score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score)
or [Student's t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test) in order to detect performance regressions and gerenerate Alerts.

## Z-score

The Z-score measures the number of [standard deviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) a given Metric is above or below the mean of historical Metrics.
This is done using either the Left Side Boundary and/or the Right Side Boundary.
For example, a 2σ 

## Student's t-test

There are several different kinds of Student's t-tests.
Bencher uses a one-sample t-test.

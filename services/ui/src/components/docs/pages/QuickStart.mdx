## What is Bencher?

Bencher is a suite of open source tools designed to catch performance regressions in CI. If you believe [performance is a feature](https://blog.codinghorror.com/performance-is-a-feature), then Bencher is the tool you have been missing.

Though bencher is open source, there is also a hosted version available at [bencher.dev](https://bencher.dev).

`cargo install --path services/cli --locked`

`bencher --version`

## What is Bencher?

Bencher is a suite of open source tools designed to catch performance regressions in CI. If you believe [performance is a feature](https://blog.codinghorror.com/performance-is-a-feature), then Bencher is the tool you have been missing.

Though Bencher is open source, there is also a hosted version available at [bencher.dev](https://bencher.dev).

## Clone the Repo

In order to work through this tutorial you will need to have `git` installed. Check to see if you have `git` installed.

Run: `git --version`

You should see something like:

```
$ git --version
git version 2.37.3
```

It is okay if your version number is different. It's just important that this command works. If not follow the [instructions for installing `git`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

<br />

With `git` installed, we can now clone the Bencher repository.

Run: `git clone https://github.com/bencherdev/bencher.git`

You should see something like:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/bencherdev/bencher.git
Cloning into 'bencher'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 24752, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (7363/7363), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2396/2396), done.
remote: Total 24752 (delta 4862), reused 7274 (delta 4785), pack-reused 17389
Receiving objects: 100% (24752/24752), 4.92 MiB | 12.43 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (16108/16108), done.
```

Again, it is okay if your output is different. It's just important that this command works.

Finally, navigate into the Bencher repo that you just cloned.

Run: `cd bencher`

## Install `bencher` CLI

In order to install the `bencher` CLI you will need to have `cargo` installed. Check to see if you have `cargo` installed.

Run: `cargo --version`

You should see something like:

```
$ cargo --version
cargo 1.65.0 (4bc8f24d3 2022-10-20)
```

It is okay if your version number is different. It's just important that this command works. If not follow the [instructions for installing `cargo` via `rustup`](https://rustup.rs/).

<br />

With `cargo` installed, we can install the `bencher` CLI.

Run: `cargo install --path services/cli --locked`

You should see something like:

```
$ cargo install --path services/cli --locked
  Installing bencher_cli v0.2.28 (/workspace/bencher/services/cli)
    Updating crates.io index
    ...
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.27s
  Installing /workspace/.cargo/bin/bencher
   Installed package `bencher_cli v0.2.28 (/workspace/bencher/services/cli)` (executable `bencher`)
```

Again, it is okay if your output is different. It's just important that this command works. When running this command, you should be in the root folder of the Bencher repo.

<br />

Finally, lets test that we have the `bencher` CLI installed.

Run: `bencher --version`

You should see something like:

```
$ bencher --version
bencher 0.2.28
```

As before, it is okay if your version number is different. It's just important that this command works.

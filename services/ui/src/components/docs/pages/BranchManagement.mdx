There are a few options for setting the project branch in the `bencher` CLI `run` command (ie: `bencher run`).

### `--branch`

<br />

The simplest is to set the `--branch` flag or the `BENCHER_BRANCH` environment variable to the branch slug or UUID of an already existing branch.

However, if both of these are missing or the provided value is invalid, then the `bencher run` command will error. This is not the most convient in CI/CD environments, where new branches are popping up all the time. Instead of using `--branch` or the `BENCHER_BRANCH` environment variable, there is an `--if-branch` flag.

### `--if-branch`

<br />

The `--if-branch` flag expects a branch _name_ argument and queries to see if a single branch with that name exists. If there is exactly one branch found, then `bencher run` proceeds using that branch. Otherwise, `bencher run` will simply log and exit successfully.

For example, if `main` exists then using `--if-branch main` would find it. Then `bencher run` would proceed using `main`.

### `--else-if-branch`

<br />

Often, when working on feature branches, it would be useful to have historical data from the parent/base branch. This is where the `--else-if-branch` flag comes in. The `--else-if-branch` flag expects another branch _name_ argument. If `--if-branch` fails, then `--else-if-branch` queries to see if a single branch with that name exists. If there is exactly one branch found, then all the data from this starting point branch will be copied over to a newly created branch with the name given to `--if-branch`.

For example, if `feature_branch` does not yet exist, but `main` does exist and has historical data. Then using `--if-branch feature_branch --else-if-branch main`, would create a new branch named `feature_branch`, and it would have a copy of all the data from `main`. Then `bencher run` would proceed using `feature_branch`.

If the `--if-branch` query succeededs then `--else-if-branch` is never run, and if both `--if-branch` and `--else-if-branch` fail, `bencher run` will simply log and exit successfully.

### `--else-branch`

<br />

To guarantee in all cases that the metrics from a run are stored, there is an `--else-branch` flag. The `--else-branch` flag takes no argumetns. If `--if-branch` fails, then `--else-branch` simply creates a new branch with the name given to `--if-branch`.

For example, if `feature_branch` does not yet exist. Then using `--if-branch feature_branch --else-branch`, would create a new branch named `feature_branch`, and it would have no initial data. Then `bencher run` would proceed using `feature_branch`.

It is also possible to chain all three flags together: `--if-branch`, `--else-if-branch`, and `--else-branch`. For example, `--if-branch feature_branch --else-if-branch main --else-branch`.

If the `--if-branch` query succeededs then `--else-branch` is never run, and likewise, if `--if-else-branch` succeeds then `--else-branch` is never run. And `--else-branch` is expected to always succeed and exit successfully.

### `--endif-branch`

<br />

In CI environments, it is very common to get the branch name from a CI host provided environment variable. For example `GITHUB_REF_NAME` in GitHub Actions or `CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME` in GitLab CI. However, sometimes these environemnt variables are empty. The `--endif-branch` flag works as an optional noop flag to prevent a failure in some cases.

For example if `EMPTY_ENV_VAR` is an empty environment variable, then using `--if-branch $EMPTY_ENV_VAR` may or may not error depending on what other flags are after it. Using `--endif-branch` guarantees that the command will exit successfully, `--if-branch $EMPTY_ENV_VAR --endif-branch`.

It is also possible to chain all three flags together: `--if-branch`, `--else-if-branch`, and `--endif-branch`. For example, `--if-branch feature_branch --else-if-branch $EMPTY_ENV_VAR --endif-branch`.

It should never be necessary to use both `--else-branch` and `--endif-branch` together, as using `--else-branch` after `--if-branch` or `--else-if-branch` also accomplishes the same goal.
